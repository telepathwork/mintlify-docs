## **1. Invoice Submission**

All invoices must be submitted to [ap@telepath.work](mailto:ap@telepath.work) by the 20th of each month. Invoices should include the following mandatory information to avoid processing delays:

- **Partner Information**: Full legal name, address, and tax identification number.
- **Invoice Details**: A unique invoice number, invoice date, and the total amount due.
- **Company Information**: Our company's purchase order (PO) number, if applicable.
- **Service/Goods Description**: A clear and itemized description of the goods or services provided, including unit prices and quantities.
- **Banking Details**: Accurate and up-to-date banking information for electronic funds transfer (EFT).

**Note**: Incomplete or inaccurate invoices will be returned for correction, which may delay payment.

## **2. Payment Terms**

Our standard payment terms are Net 30 days from the date of a valid invoice, unless otherwise stipulated in a signed contract or agreement. Any deviations from these standard terms must be explicitly agreed upon in writing and will be documented in the respective contract.

## **3. Payment Processing**

Payments will be exclusively made via electronic funds transfer (EFT). It is the partnerâ€™s responsibility to ensure that their banking information on file is accurate and current. Our payment processing cycle is on a monthly basis.

## **4. Dispute Resolution**

In the event of any questions or concerns regarding a payment, partners are requested to contact our accounts payable department at [ap@telepath.work](mailto:ap@telepath.work) immediately after receiving the payment or invoice notification. We are committed to resolving all payment disputes in a fair and timely manner.
