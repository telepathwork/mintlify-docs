## **Data Storage**

Telepath uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to operate Telepath. By using Telepath Services, you authorize Telepath to transfer, store, and use your information in United States, Thailand and any other country where we operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.

Both Telepath Co., Ltd. and Stripe have access to the information that you submit through the verification flow. We rely on Stripe to help store your verification data. Stripe uses access controls and security standards that are at least as stringent as those used to handle their own KYC and payments compliance data.

## **Site Monitoring**

Telepath uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but the information may include your IP address or other identifying information.

## **Identity Verification**

We use Stripe for identity document verification. Stripe collects identity document images, facial images, ID numbers and addresses as well as advanced fraud signals and information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe shares this information with us and also uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides, including for fraud detection. You may also choose to allow Stripe to use your data to improve Stripe’s biometric verification technology. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at [**<u>https://stripe.com/privacy</u>**](https://stripe.com/privacy).

Stripe asks for your consent before collecting and using your biometric information. It’ll only use your verification data in accordance with the permissions you grant before starting the verification process, and based on its [**<u>Privacy Policy</u>**](https://https/stripe.com/privacy).

## **Data Security**

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.

## **Administrative Emails from Telepath**

Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt-out of this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account).

When you interact with a transactional email sent from Telepath (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.

Upon creating a Telepath account, you will opt into the Telepath marketing and product emails and another non-administrative email.

You can opt-out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications ~~through your account’s “~~[**~~<u>Notification Settings</u>~~**](https://telepath.work/en/settings/notifications)~~” page and~~ at the link of the footer in any non-administrative email you receive from us.

When you interact with a non-administrative email sent from Telepath (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.

## **Deleting Your Personal Information**

~~You can delete your account from ~~[**~~<u>Settings \> Account</u>~~**](https://telepath.work/en/settings/account)~~ by yourself.~~ You may request deletion of your personal information and account by emailing [**<u>support@telepath.work</u>**](mailto:support@telepath.work) Make sure the request sent for deletion is from a registered email id associated with the Telepath account.

To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may maintain residual copies for a brief time period. But, if you delete your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable after that time.

## **Business Transfers**

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance of any such change.

## **Changes to this Policy**

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Effective Date,” above, to reflect the date of the changes.
